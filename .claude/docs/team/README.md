## What Is This?

The 32-agent team is a layered agent operating system built on Claude Code, designed for complex engineering work across Go (<go-service>), Python (<python-service>), TypeScript (<frontend>), BEAM/Elixir (<beam-service>), and GCP infrastructure. The team is led by a CTO agent with full authority, supported by 28 specialist agents + 2 verification agents (evidence-validator, challenger) + 1 optional intuition-oracle (Shadow Mind surface) organized into 8 tiers, and hardened by protocol-enforcement hooks, a 352-assertion contract test suite, and a data-driven trust ledger.

The team's defining innovations are:
- The **NEXUS Protocol** — a syscall interface that bridges the Claude Code privilege boundary, letting subagents request privileged main-thread operations without directly possessing those tools
- The **Dynamic Domain Expert Acquisition** pipeline (`talent-scout` + `recruiter`) — the team can detect its own coverage gaps and hire new specialist agents through an 8-phase gated pipeline
- The **Shadow Mind** — an optional parallel cognitive layer (Observer + Pattern Computer + Speculator + Dreamer + Pattern Library + intuition-oracle) that offers probabilistic pattern-based guidance via the `[NEXUS:INTUIT]` syscall, delete-to-disable without affecting the conscious team

### 🎭 [TEAM_SCENARIOS.md](TEAM_SCENARIOS.md)
**Copy-paste-ready workflows.** 19 real-world scenarios:
1. Production incident response
2. New feature build (full-stack)
3. Security review (pre-merge)
4. Architecture decision
5. Performance optimization
6. Infrastructure change
7. Code quality audit (proactive)
8. Test strategy design
9. Cross-service dependency change
10. Team evolution (meta-work)
11. Simple tasks (anti-pattern)
12. Session start best practice
13. **Verification — Trust But Verify** (evidence-validator workflow)
14. **Adversarial Review of CTO Synthesis** (challenger workflow)
15. **Team Health Monitoring** (contract tests + trust ledger + signal bus drain)
16. **BEAM kernel build / Phase 0 ramp** (beam-architect + elixir-engineer×2 + beam-sre)
17. **Independent Gate 2 validation** (erlang-solutions-consultant retainer)
18. **Systemic capability gap → hiring pipeline** (talent-scout → recruiter → meta-agent)
19. **Shadow Mind intuition for fast-path decisions** (`[NEXUS:INTUIT]` usage)

Each includes: situation, agent chain, exact prompts, expected output, variations.

## Reading Order Recommendation

### First-time user
1. TEAM_OVERVIEW.md (understand what the team IS)
2. TEAM_SCENARIOS.md (see how it WORKS in real cases)
3. TEAM_RUNBOOK.md (learn how to OPERATE it)
4. TEAM_CHEATSHEET.md (internalize quick reference)

### Returning user
1. TEAM_CHEATSHEET.md (refresh memory)
2. TEAM_SCENARIOS.md (find the scenario matching today's work)

### During a session
- TEAM_RUNBOOK.md → "Common Failure Modes" if something's off
- TEAM_CHEATSHEET.md → "Activation Phrases" to engage the right agent

## Contributing

This documentation is maintained by the team itself. When you discover new patterns, failure modes, or use cases:

1. Update the relevant doc file directly
2. Add a MEMORY HANDOFF signal if it's a finding worth persisting
3. Add an EVOLUTION SIGNAL if an agent prompt needs improvement
4. meta-agent will process signals during Pattern F
